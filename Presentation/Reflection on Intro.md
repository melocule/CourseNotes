# Where I Am as a Presenter

Hi! I was the student from the first virtual session that mentioned wanting to be better at improvizing because I feel anxious without a script.

## On the Triangle

I'm challenged by the **Thought** and **Emotional** parts of the triangle.
When I have to present, I get very anxious beforehand and seek criticism afterward with the assumption that I performed horribly unless explicitly reassured by someone I believe is honest. 
To calm the anxiousness I think that to minimize risk I should overprepare, scripting *everything*. This makes me less anxious before presenting, but more anxious *during* it because:
- I become a script-reading machine
- Lose ability to word things on the spot
- Trouble regaining position upon interruption
- No longer understand the meaning of what I'm saying as I'm saying it

## Detailed Example

Here's a timeline of how I experienced the first presentation:
- As soon as the presentations were mentioned, I felt anxious and fidgety. I had a topic, but the days preceding this I had tried to keep myself from preparing the details so that I could use this class to practice for improvization.
- Once we partnered up I had trouble getting started because I was anxious, and avoided eye contact while practice-presenting to feel more at ease. 
- Once people began presenting, I was not able to pay attention to the speakers who came before me and felt like I needed to focus on what *I* should do and say when *I* go up. I wanted to do something creative and attention-grabbing.
- During my presentation, I was focused on performing. I used bullet points in my head this time, and actually felt less anxious this time than when I rely on a script‚Äî I think that when I'm just reading a script, my brain feels like it needs to be *more* anxious in order to push me to use all the brainpower that's just sitting around.
- The moment it ended, I felt embarassed and self conscious, and ducked away to my seat. I was able to relax for the remainder of the presentations.
- After-class, I wasn't sure how it went since I didn't have feedback so assumed it went poorly.

# This Semester

## What to Challenge

I happened to take a neuropsych test last semester, and some of the results are sources for my challenges as a presenter.

**üìù> üëÑ** 
My verbal intelligence score was low relative to my writing intelligence score. I tend to take longer than others to form verbal responses during conversations, just to the point where some lag is noticable.
This explains why I tend to feel more comfortable texting than speaking in emotionally stressful situations such as presentations.

**üéØ > ‚è≥**
I over-prefer accuracy over speed for tasks. Even in contexts where I'm explicity told that speed is the priority, I feel like I need to make sure I'm doing it right. This makes me time-inefficient, which relates to my overpreparation and taking longer to form responses.

## How to Challenge

If I didn't take myself seriously, my inner critic would let me mess up more, which will make me less anxious to prepare for presentations. I can't exactly just tell myself to care less though.

And even then, I would still choke during presentations unless I had bullet points. I want to be able to improvize comfortably. I think that will just take **practice**.
